# Severe Weather Database

This application was built as a series of mini-projects, each relevant to a specific  
modules of the Data Engineering curriculum.  

Although most of the tangible work products generated were not incorporated into the  
production deployment, the insights gained directly inform the final design.  

In this way, this section should serve as an excellent reference if & when the myriad  
issues that were encountered resurface during future efforts developing cloud ELT applications.  

Each stage is found below under the format...
