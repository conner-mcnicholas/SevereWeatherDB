# Capstone Project: Storm Events Database  

  Data Engineering Track, Springboard School of Data

-----

## Background

  This cloud database of US storm events since 1950 is my official submission for the  
  "Open Ended Capstone Project", part of the *Data Engineering* curriculum at __Springboard's School of Data__.

## Objective

  The objective of the Capstone is to identify a large raw dataset from which one could derive value,  
  then develop and deploy a solution enabling the extraction, ingestion, and transformation of that  
  data towards some practical application.

### *Repository Organization*:

This repository is divided into two directories:

##### `FinalBuild`

Inside the FinalBuild folder is a link to a seperate repository, `StormEventsDB`, containing the files that are strictly required for production deployment of the app.  

The title change (i.e. 'SevereWeather' --> 'StormEvents') more accurately reflects the terminology used in NOAA/NCEI literature.  

There are no dependencies between the two repositories.

##### `ProjectJourney`

This project was completed as a series of 10 mini-projects (i.e. `Steps`), with each Step reinforcing a progressively more advanced data engineering concept while culminating in the deployment of a production-ready cloud app.  

The majority of the deliverables generated prior to the penultimate step were not ultimately required for (or even relevant to) the final application build.  

That "mini-project work" is retained here, where a more detailed overview of the process is also provided in its `README`.
