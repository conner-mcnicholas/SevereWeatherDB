# Capstone Project: Storm Events Database

Data Engineering Track, Springboard School of Data

_______

### Background

This cloud database of US storm events since 1950 is my official submission for
the "Open Ended Capstone Project" - part of the *Data Engineering* curriculum at
**Springboard's School of Data**.

### Objective

The objective of the Capstone is to identify a large raw dataset from which
one could derive value, then develop and deploy a solution enabling the
extraction, ingestion, and transformation of that data towards some practical
application.

### Repository Organization:

This repository is divided into two directories:

### 1) ProjectJourney

This project was completed as a series of 10 mini-projects (i.e. 'Steps'), with
each Step reinforcing a progressively more advanced data engineering concept while  
culminating in the deployment of a production-ready cloud app.

The majority of the deliverables generated prior to the penultimate step were not ultimately
required for (or even relevant to) the final application build.  That "mini-project work"
is retained here, where a more detailed overview of the process is also provided in its `README`

### 2) FinalBuild

Packaged separately are the files that are strictly required for deployment of the end user app.  
Although there are limited instances in which the same filename exists in both directories, there is
no expectation that the file contents or purpose are equivalent across alternate versions of any
duplicated filename.  To summarize - this should be considered a separate, standalone unit.  
(In fact I plan on recreating it as a truly separate git root repository after the Capstone has been
reviewed and approved by faculty).
