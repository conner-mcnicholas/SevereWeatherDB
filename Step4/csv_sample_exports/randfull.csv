An nearly stationary upper low near the Texas and Louisiana state line provided lift and instability for showers and thunderstorms across the Central Gulf States. An inverted surface trough was located along the I-20 corridor on September 18th, and provided a focus for slow moving thunderstorms that produced flash flooding across Tuscaloosa, Jefferson and Shelby counties. The upper trough moved slightly eastward on the 19th and the flooding threat shifted to areas east of I-65.",Severe flooding across the cities of Northport and Tuscaloosa.  Water was 2-3 feet deep along portions of 14th Avenue in the city of Tuscaloosa with numerous roads flooded and impassable across the city.

Unfortunately, one person lost their life due to the flood waters. Across Owen county, roads had suffered severe damage, 23 culverts had been washed out and 2 bridges have significant damage.  In all, over 30 Owen County roads were closed. A local emergency disaster declaration was created later in the day. Power outages across the state peaked at nearly 150,000.

Thunderstorm activity formed by the late morning hours and intensified as the day progressed. Several reports of large hail was received across central and eastern New Mexico, and a few tornadoes and landspouts were observed across the plains. The anomalously moist air mass allowed for heavy rain to fall as well, especially across south central and southeast New Mexico which received rainfall totals of three to five inches in a very short period of time. This led to flash flooding in Lincoln and Chaves counties in which several water rescues had to be performed. Widespread damage was reported as well with multiple businesses, homes, and vehicles being inundated with flood waters. Tragically, one individual in southern Lincoln County drowned while trying to cross a flooded roadway in their vehicle.",Trained spotters in Tinnie reported hail ranging from the size of nickels to the size of golf balls from a severe thunderstorm moving east through the area.,2021-05-30,44120,D,47,F,Vehicle/Towed Trailer

A warm front moved northward into Middle Tennessee early on March 27 before stalling near the I-40 corridor. Between 300-400 AM CDT, numerous showers and thunderstorms developed along the warm front, many of which became severe and produced large hail up to half dollar size along with frequent lightning and heavy rainfall. Showers and storms continued off and on the rest of the day across Middle Tennessee, particularly near the stalled warm front. In fact, another round of severe thunderstorms including supercells developed during the afternoon and evening hours near and south of the warm front. These storms dropped large hail up to tennis ball size and caused a few reports of wind damage, but the main impact was additional heavy rainfall which began causing flash flooding south of Nashville. Flooding only worsened as showers and storms redeveloped over the same areas through the evening, with numerous Flash Flood Warnings issued and several reports of flooded roads and water rescues.||After midnight, even more heavy rainfall falling along the already waterlogged I-40 corridor prompted a rare Flash Flood Emergency for the southern and eastern Nashville metro area, including southeastern Davidson County, western Wilson County, and northern Williamson County. These areas received between 7 to 9 of rain, causing rapid rises on several Nashville metro creeks and streams, including Sevenmile Creek (which reached its highest level on record), Browns Creek, and Mill Creek, among others. Many of these creeks reached within their 2nd or 3rd highest water levels on record. The rapid water rises flooded hundreds of homes and businesses, with reports of some people trapped in the attics or on the roofs of their houses. Dozens of roadways were flooded and impassable, including both I-24 and I-40, with many cars submerged in the flood waters and people forced to cling onto trees to avoid getting swept away. Although the flood waters receded quickly on Sunday, March 28, many area rivers reached flood stage in the week after the event, including the Cumberland River, Harpeth River, and Duck River.||A total of 7 deaths were reported from the flooding across Middle Tennessee, with 5 in Davidson County, 1 in Cheatham County, and 1 in Maury County. Emergency management reports indicate over 500 homes and businesses were flooded, and a Presidential Disaster Proclamation was declared for many counties in May 2021. This flash flood event was the worst seen in Middle Tennessee since the May 1-2, 2010 flood.","Several roads were flooded across southern Cheatham County, including West Kingston Springs Road, and Highway 70 at Pinnacle Hill Road.",2021-03-28,42940,D,65,M,Vehicle/Towed Trailer

This event brought widespread significant, and sometimes historic record setting rainfall to locations across Southeast Alaska. There were multiple waves along the main front to produce a quasi-stationary front and allowed heavy precipitation to persist over the panhandle for a long duration. Rainfall amounts were as high as over 15 at Little Port Walter with most other locations reporting 5 to 12 over the 2 days. Juneau, Skagway and Haines airports broke their all time daily precipitation record on December 1st along with the all time 2 day total when both days are combined. Rainfall intensity recurrence intervals  ranged from a 50 to 200 year event when looking at 6,12,24,48 hour time periods. In some locations the precipitation started out as snow, minor accumulations but then changed quickly over to moderate/heavy rain. Significant snowfall did occur mainly at high elevations and along the Haines and Klondike highways before transition to rain as temperatures rose above freezing all the way up to 6000 feet with the impacting warm front. Snow accumulations were very impressive from December 1st into the 2nd with 18 at 800 feet near the Haines US customs border station and a staggering 59 at 2560 feet on Mount Ripinski above Haines. There was persistent precipitation that occured the previous weeks to keep the soils on the wet side. The heavy precipitation and warm temperatures melted snow that had already accumulated on the ground at sea level then as the snow level climbed above the mountain top this increased the amount of runoff significantly from the mountains. All the excess runoff resulted in significant and in places record flooding of roads and homes, erosion that damaged roads and infrastructure, and widespread mass wasting events such as landslides and debris flows. Most of these impacts were reported to have started in the early morning hours of December 2nd and persist into December 3rd or longer. The northern half of Southeast Alaska saw most if not all of these impacts with a few specific rivers, Salmon River in Gustavus and Jordan Creek in Juneau, seeing record river stage values. Widespread damaging debris flows impacted Juneau, Skagway and Haines that took out roads, destroyed homes and caused 2 fatalities in Haines. ��To go along with the heavy precipitation there was also very strong damaging winds as the waves moved along the front over the panhandle. These strong winds damaged power lines from falling trees.��In total there were about 7 communities (Haines, Juneau, Skagway, Gustavus, Hoonah, Tenakee Springs, and Hyder) that declared a disaster from this event.","As the atmospheric river moved over the northern inner channels of Southeast Alaska it produced significant amount of precipitation from December 1-2. The snow level was near sea level at the on December 1 with accumulations of  5 to 7 inches with as much as 40 inches at high elevations over 2 days. The snow level rose above the mountain tops through the early morning hours of December 2 and started to melt the fresh snow to increase the amount of runoff. Through December 2 there was about 15 inches of snowpack loss at high elevation and almost all the snow melted off at sea level which led to significant amount of runoff into local rivers and overwhelmed culverts that damaged roads from erosion. In Dyea very heavy precipitation of 4 inches fell in 10 hours through the early morning hours of December 2 with a total of 7.5 in 2 days fell. In Skagway, December 1 broke the all time daily precipitation record with 3.67 and it also broke the 2 day all time precipitation record with 6.09. The COOP in Skagway reported 9.92 in 3 days which was close to a 1000 year event.  The Taiya River near Dyea rose 4.5 feet in 12 hours and cresting in the afternoon of December 2nd just over bankfull from all the precipitation and snowmelt runoff. That is very high river levels for this time of year along with how fast the river rose. The soils were very saturated from the heavy precipitation and snowmelt to help destabilize the steep slopes at the same time there was some windy conditions to increase the risk of debris flows. Multiple debris flows blocked the Dyea road cutting them off from Skagway in the early morning hours of December 2 when the highest rain rates were occuring.",2020-12-02,42379,D,30,M,Permanent Home

Tropical moisture streaming into the Carolinas throughout this time resulted in development of heavy rainfall, with widespread rainfall amounts of 4 to 6 inches, with locally higher amounts across the foothills and Piedmont of North Carolina. This resulted in areas of flash flooding and main stem river flooding, some of which was significant, resulting in multiple fatalities and significant damage.","Stream gauges indicated flash flooding developed along numerous creeks throughout the Charlotte area after 3.5 to 4.5 inches of rain fell across much of the city, with the bulk of that falling in about a 3-hour period during the morning of the 12th. The most significant flooding occurred along the Sugar Creek and Little Sugar Creek basins, where several gauges reported moderate to even major flooding. Water from Sugar Creek inundated multiple buildings along Southern Pines Blvd and Red Oak Blvd. Little Sugar Creek overflowed and impacted several homes in the Parkstone neighborhood as well as several structures along Highway 51 in Pineville. On the opposite side of the city, significant flooding developed along Mallard Creek in the University City area, impacting homes on Dashiel Dr and Circle Dr. Irwin Creek also inundated Statesville Rd just north of Uptown. Steele Creek flooded in the Carowinds area, flooding several mobile homes along John Price Rd. Otherwise, multiple roads were inundated along Briar Creek and McMullen Creek in the east and southeast part of the city, and along Stewart Creek and Irwin Creek on the north side and near Uptown. Long Creek also flooded roads near Mountain Island Lake, while Clarks Creek overflowed and flooded multiple vehicles in the far north part of the city.

These initial storms grew upscale given concurrent downstream destabilization through northeast Nebraska and northwest Iowa. Widespread 80-100 mph winds developed through central/eastern Iowa as this derecho matured. Northern bookend and advection wing forcing led to some supercell structures across northern Illinois/southwest Wisconsin. Northern bookend turned northeast as it moved across Lake Michigan and tracked into western Michigan. As this occurred, attendant post convective wake low weakened as it crossed the lake. Thus the local area did not experience the 80 to 100 mph winds that N IL/E IA experienced. However the resultant slowing and breakup of the line as it moved across northwest Indiana/SW Michigan, yielded a LEWP and subsequent multiple small scale circulations developing along the line.
