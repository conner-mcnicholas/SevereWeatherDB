-----------------------------------MONTHLY UPDATE FILE PIPELINE TEST-------------------------------------------

  IN BLOB CONTAINER
  -- RENAME 2022 FILE IN ARCHIVE CONTAINER TO SHOW MODIFIED DATE OF LAST MONTH 20220516

  IN UPDATE SCRIPT, (PRIOR TO RUNNING UPDATE LOGIC)

  -- SET RowsPreDelete -> SELECT count(*) FROM test_{table};-- (all rows in table before deletion)
  -- DELETE from TEST_{table} where BEGIN_YEARMONTH = '202203';

  RUNNING ADF UPDATE PIPELINE WILL IDENTIFY NEWER SOURCE FILE AVAILABLE THAN THE FILE WE RENAMED 20220616, APPENDS ALL 202203 ROWS

  IN CLEANUP SCRIPT, (AT VERY END, BUT ORDER DOESNT MATTER)

  -- Set RowsPostUpdate -> select count(*) from test_{table};-- (all rows in this table after update)

  VERIFY vPreDelete.RowsPostUpdate == RowsPreDelete
