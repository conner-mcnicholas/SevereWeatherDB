# Capstone Project: Storm Events Database  

  Data Engineering Track, Springboard School of Data

  _____

## Background

  This cloud database of US storm events since 1950 is my official submission for the  
  "Open Ended Capstone Project", part of the *Data Engineering* curriculum at __Springboard's School of Data__.

## Objective

  The objective of the Capstone is to identify a large raw dataset from which one could derive value,  
  then develop and deploy a solution enabling the extraction, ingestion, and transformation of that  
  data towards some practical application.

### \**Repository Organization*:

  This repository is divided into two directories:

##### `ProjectJourney`

This project was completed as a series of 10 mini-projects (i.e. `Steps`), with each Step reinforcing  
a progressively more advanced data engineering concept while culminating in the deployment of a  
production-ready cloud app.  


The majority of the deliverables generated prior to the penultimate step were not ultimately  
required for (or even relevant to) the final application build.  That "mini-project work"  
is retained here, where a more detailed overview of the process is also provided in its `README`

##### `FinalBuild`

I have created a separate repository "StormEventsDB" for the final build, containing the files that are strictly required for deployment of the app:

https://github.com/conner-mcnicholas/StormEventsDB

The new naming convention more accurately reflects the language used NOAA/NCEI.

After applying some finishing touches, I will import that repo to the FinalBuild directory as a git submodule, but until then I want to avoid the added git complexity, so the hyperlink serves as a placeholder.

Although there are limited instances in which the same filename exists in that repository and ProjectJourney, there is no expectation that the file contents or purpose are equivalent across alternate versions of any  
duplicated filename.
