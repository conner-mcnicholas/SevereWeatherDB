# Severe Weather Database

This application was built as a series of mini-projects, each relevant to a specific
modules of the Data Engineering curriculum.

Although most of the tangible work products generated were not incorporated into the
production deployment, the insights gained directly inform the final design.

In this way, this section should serve as an excellent reference if & when the myriad
issues that were encountered resurface during future efforts developing cloud ELT applications.

Each Step is tagged with the named goal and relevant data engineering subject in [brackets]

Note that each folder contains:
  -Step_<#>_Instructions.pdf: instructionions document describing premise and requirements
  +one OR both:
  -README.md: summarizing the completed deliverables
  -<named goal>.pdf: slide deck detailing the work done
