Nearly every step of this process presented technical obstacles beyond the normal
tweaks required when following slightly outdated instructions.

1) aztk , the  Azure Data Engineering Toolkit cli that was prescribed by the
project instructions, would not initialize after installing using pip
for Python 3.10, due to a compatability issue in a dependency:
`s = pack('>I', n & 0xffffffffL) + s SyntaxError: invalid syntax`
Based on troubleshooting on the web, it seemed like this
was a Python2 -> Python3 incompatability issue, but one obscure forum comment
suggested Python3.6 showed no issues on an earlier release of Ubuntu.

2) pyenv virtualenvwrapper would not run using "mkvirtualenv", complaining
that virtualenvwrapper could not find /usrbin/virtualenvwrapper in my PATH,
even after explicitly setting my PATH to point to it.  I had to reinstall
pyenv and virtualenv using 'sudo pip' instead of 'pip'.

3) Trying to get ANY Python < 3.10 installed using pyenv was a nonstarter,
attempting installing python pyenv ran into:
Segmentation fault (core dumped) make: *** [Makefile:1102: install] Error 139
Installing an obscure patch from a forum, and trying various different subversions
eventually sorted the downloading issue out.  Setting the pyenv global version
was not enough to allow a virtual env to be created with mkvirtualenv -p 3.*.*,
as it would throw:
RuntimeError: failed to find interpreter for Builtin discover of python_spec='3.*.*'.
I had to pyenv init python=3.6.8 to force it to create to that python version
implicitly.

4) Finally, I was able to initialize aztk. The success was shortlived, as
the command prescribed in the instructions:

wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/aztk/v0.7.0/account_setup.sh -O account_setup.sh
&& chmod 755 account_setup.sh
&& /bin/bash account_setup.sh

Threw the error:

"TypeError: signed_session() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given"

The official azure account had responded to a thread on this issue by saying
the script is too outdated, and so the manual process for creating all of the
necessary resources in Azure, and accurately filling out secrets.yaml was
required.  Because the Azure portal UI has changed quite dramatically since
the manual instructions Microsoft linked to was created, this process was
very difficult to follow.

5) After much clicking, searching, scanning, and cursing, I located all of the API keys, created
all of the credentials, granted all of the permissions, enabled all of the applications,
registered for all of the services, etc, etc, until....

At long last....I had finally connected:

(env368) conner@Linuxclevo:~$ aztk spark cluster list
/home/conner/.virtualenvs/env368/lib/python3.6/site-packages/azure/storage/blob/_encryption.py:13: CryptographyDeprecationWarning: Python 3.6 is no longer supported by the Python core team. Therefore, support for it is deprecated in cryptography and will be removed in a future release.
  from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.padding import PKCS7
Cluster                           | State     | VM Size             | Nodes  | Created
----------------------------------|-----------|---------------------|--------|-----------------

But this was only the beginning of my issues.  Trying to create a new cluster...

Spent 5+ hours figuring out that you can't run "aztk spark cluster create"
while WITHIN the .aztk folder without throwing python errors,
Spent another 5+ hours debugging more aztk code.  I had to update 1 line in
1 file to point my azure batch client to Ubuntu Server 18.04 instead of 16.04.
BUTT making this same update to another line of code breaks everything.
I'll never get these 24 hours of my life back.

This joy was shortlived, as it turns out these vms wouldn't initialize with any nodes:

(env368) conner@Linuxclevo:~$ aztk spark cluster get --id spkpipeline
/home/conner/.virtualenvs/env368/lib/python3.6/site-packages/azure/storage/blob/_encryption.py:13: CryptographyDeprecationWarning: Python 3.6 is no longer supported by the Python core team. Therefore, support for it is deprecated in cryptography and will be removed in a future release.
  from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.padding import PKCS7

Cluster         spkpipeline
------------------------------------------
State:          steady
Node Size:      standard_d12_v2
Created:        2022-06-15 05:51:38
Nodes:          0
| Dedicated:    0
| Low priority: 0

|               Nodes                |        State        |        IP:Port       | Dedicated  |  Master  |
|------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|------------|----------|

I'm trying a newer tactic, this entire toolkit is clearly obsolete and worthless.

note: this may be due to having zero quota for vm nodes on my batch account?!
Azure makes this so difficult.
